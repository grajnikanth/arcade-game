Udacity Front End Developer - Project 3 - Arcade Game

This is the Project 3 for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. In this I developed the javascript code to create the functionality of the arcade-game. The game consists of a game board with image tiles on which three enemies move from left to right. The player starts at the bottom middle of the game board and the goal is to reach the top of the game board without colliding with the enemies moving on the game board. The player movement is controlled by the left, right, up and down arrow keys.

The javascript files are located in the /js/ folder. There are three .js files:
app.js
engine.js
resources.js

The engine.js and resources.js files were provided by Udacity.

app.js file is where most my code is located. 

In app.js I created the classes Enemy and Player. Then I added all the properties and functions to make the game.

See the comments in all the three .js files for detailed information on how the various variables and functions work.

We also have the index.html file which takes care of the basic html of the game. This was provided by Udacity as well with starter code.

I added the html for creating the modal required to display the window when the game is won by the player.

Also in the /css/ folder the style.css file has all the styling related to the index.html file.
I added the styling needed to display the modal.
